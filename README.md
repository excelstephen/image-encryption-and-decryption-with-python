# image-encryption-and-decryption-with-python

This project demonstrates how to use the Python programming language to encrypt any image file with an encryption key. 
The file can also be decrypted using the code itself.

To use this project, follow the steps below to Encrypt any image file;
1. Change the image name in Line 1 of the "Encrypt.py" source code to the name of the image you want to encrypt
2. Also, change the image name in Line 13 of the the "Encrypt.py" source code to the name of the  desired encrypted image name
3. Open command prompt, and locate the directory of the the "Encrypt.py" source code.
4. Run the command "python Encrypt.py"

Also, follow the steps below to Decrypt any image file;
1. Change the image name in Line 1 of the "Decrypt.py" source code to the name of the image you want to decrypt
2. Also, change the image name in Line 13 of the the "Decrypt.py" source code to the name of the  desired decrypted image name
3. Open command prompt, and locate the directory of the the "Decrypt.py" source code.
4. Run the command "python Decrypt.py"
